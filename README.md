# GUIslice Solutions


## Brief Overview

The sample Applications here work with [GUIslice API](https://github.com/ImpulseAdventure/GUIslice) 
and [GUIsliceBuilder](https://github.com/ImpulseAdventure/GUIslice-Builder).

<p>
The GUIslice API framework code can handle hardware like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32 and more. It supports Graphic libraries like 
Adafruit's GFX, M5Stack, TFT_eSPI and LINUX with a wide variety of TFT Display Drivers and combinations of Touch support chips. 
While GUIslice Builder is a standalone desktop application that is more than a layout tool for your UI. It's designed as 
Low Code GUI Generator for User Interfaces that make use of GUIslice API.

<p>
GUIslice Solutions is selection of sample applications that I have written over the years. 
They go beyond the examples provided with the GUIslice API package and demostrate the more advanced
features of the api. Some have been rejected or diluted for inclusion with the GUIslice Examples
having been deemed too complicated. However, many of them have been requested by users of the API to 
solve specific problems. Most have been posted in one form or another within the issues sections of GUIslice API 
and GUIslice Builder. This has made them somewhat hard to find and often needed to be posted more than once.
So I have gathered them here in one place to make them more accessible.
