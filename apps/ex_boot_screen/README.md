# Sample Application with a Startup Booting Screen

<p>
Demonstrates displaying a screen at start that waits for any hardware
initialization that may be needed. 
</p>

<p>
The sample is set for Arduino using AdaFruit_GFX library and a standard
320x240 pixel display but you can use the GUIsliceBuilder to set these
to any supported platform. Simply use the PROJECT_OPTIONS tab inside 
the builder and choose your IDE, screen size and graphics package.
