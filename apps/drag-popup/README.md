# Drag Popup Application

<p>
Demonstrates how to make a popup window draggable by a user. 
The user simply selects and holds down on the popup window's title bar
and they can drag the window around the screen. The utility macro
moveElem together with the GUIslice API call gslc_InvalidateRgnPage() 
can also be used to move relocate any element desired on any page.

<p>
The sample is set for Arduino using AdaFruit_GFX library and a standard
320x240 pixel display but you can use the GUIsliceBuilder to set these
to any supported platform. Simply use the PROJECT_OPTIONS tab inside 
the builder and choose your IDE, screen size and graphics package.
